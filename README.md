# enodo-ui-challenge

Your challenge, if you choose to accept it, is to take this unstyled vue.js project and turn it into the mockup below. In order to accomplish this, you may use whatever libraries you feel would work best or you may stick to just css. If you have any questions about the design, please reach out to Rob.

Then, in a second part, propose improvements to the proposed design taking style and UX into account.

We look forward to your submission. Good luck.
